        <p>I am a transplant from the hospitality industry into the field of software development. Through attending an accelerated full stack web development program at Galvanize, I have worked diligently to learn as much as I can to launch my new career. I am a full stack developer who specializes in JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks. I enjoy helping to architect and bring exciting project ideas to life.</p>
        <p>Some of my interests outside of coding include cooking, nutrition, golf, video games, psychology, and trying to learn Korean.</p>
